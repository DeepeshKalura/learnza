# System Design

## Q1: Why did you choose Flutter for this project?
**A:** I selected Flutter because the project requires creating a mobile application, and Flutter is well-suited for cross-platform development. It enables rapid development, a consistent user interface, and smooth performance across multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, and the web.

## Q2: What progress has been made so far in Week 1?  
**A:** In the first week (two days), I completed:  
1. Setting up the project environment.  
2. Designing the database schema.  
3. Establishing a basic project structure.  
4. Implementing CI/CD builds for Flutter web.  

## Q3: Why did you choose Flutter for web development as well?  
**A:** Due to limited time, I decided to use Flutter for both mobile and web development. Flutter's ability to provide a unified codebase across platforms ensures faster development and reduces the need for maintaining separate codebases. 

## Q4: Why did you choose Firebase for the backend?  
**A:** Firebase was chosen for the following reasons:  
- **Cost Efficiency:** The project remains within Firebase's free tier, making it cost-effective.  
- **Realtime Database:** Firebase Realtime Database is ideal for high read-and-write operations with good bandwidth.  
- **Seamless Integration:** Firebase integrates well with Flutter, simplifying development and deployment processes.  

## Q5: How will the app be hosted?  
**A:** I am using Firebase Hosting for deploying the application due to its simplicity, reliability, and compatibility with CI/CD workflows.

## Q6: Have you prepared documentation for the project?  
**A:** Yes, I have developed comprehensive documentation to ensure that the project setup, structure, and development process are clear and understandable. This documentation will allow others to easily appreciate and contribute to the project.
