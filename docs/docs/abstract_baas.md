## What I wish

I want to create a abstract BaaS (Backend as a Service) that can be used by any frontend application. This BaaS should be able to handle user authentication, data storage, and data retrieval. If the firebase costing money high then i can switch to this new BaaS. Like Pocket base or create my own service from postgresql

## Why I didn't do this?

THe answer is simple because I don't have enough time to do this. I have to have only 4 weeks to complete this project. So I have to use firebase for this project. But I will try to create this BaaS in the future, if I have enough time.
